It s a naked portrait featuring the trust fund tycoon s reportedly tiny manhood.Tattoo artist Spooks Joya, who created the tattoo, spoke to VICE about how the artwork came about, saying in an email: I actually saw the original picture by Illma Gore and thought it was awesome I researched what the piece stood for and couldn t resist not doing it, so I offered to do it for free on anyone who wanted. It started out as a joke but I was surprised people seriously wanted to get it done. Men and women. It was nuts!! It seems men and women were literally queueing up to pay the ultimate insult to Donald Trump   and it really is a monstrosity. The tattoo is up on the thigh of a man who remains anonymous, but we do have pictures of the tattoo being completed.This might be the appropriate moment to ask: who on earth would do this to themselves? And WHY?!For those unaware of the background, Trump has been smarting for a quarter of a century over a slight made against him by journalist Graydon Carter. The Vanity Fair writer wrote a negative piece on Trump, in which he called him a  short-fingered vulgarian . Last October, Carter published a piece in Vanity Fair entitled: Why Donald Trump Will Always Be a  Short-Fingered Vulgarian - in which he detailed Trump s thin-skinned response to the criticism, and his refusal to let the matter go. He writes:Like so many bullies, Trump has skin of gossamer. He thinks nothing of saying the most hurtful thing about someone else, but when he hears a whisper that runs counter to his own vainglorious self-image, he coils like a caged ferret. Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a  short-fingered vulgarian  in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago. To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers.And so it was, that Trump decided that a Primary debate to decide the Republican nominee for President of the United States, was the appropriate place to brag about the size of his penis. After Marco Rubio referenced the sight in a March debate, Trump told the crowd: Look at those hands. Are they small hands?  holding his (admittedly stubby) fingers out towards the audience and the cameras. He referred to my hands,  if they re small, something else must be small.  I guarantee you there s no problem. I guarantee. It seems for one person in particular, the comedy pay-off was worth it.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons\",\n          \"President Trump wants those who settled sexual harassment cases using our tax dollars to be exposed The House is responsible for the sexual assault slush fund that used our taxpayer money to pay off accusers. We should all call for this slush fund to be shut down This is NOT what our hard earned money should be paying for NEW: President Trump tells me he believe Congress should release the names of lawmakers who have settled sexual harassment claims  Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) November 21, 2017The Transcript and video of Rep. Jackie Speier on  Face the Nation,  Nov. 19, 2017 is below. She spoke to John Dickerson and Chuck Todd before that about the $15 million in settlements for sexual harassment by congress members. Americans are furious that their tax dollars are being used in such a way WITHOUT the harasser being held accountable. These gropers should pay for this themselves!HERE S THE COMMENT FROM THE INTERVIEW BELOW THAT REALLY STANDS OUT:  we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked. Doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified. So the Office of Compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed.    REP JACKIE SPEIERRep. Jackie Speier, D-California, joined  Face the Nation  Sunday to discuss the fallout from the flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations across the U.S., and sexual harassment in Congress.JOHN DICKERSON: The debate over sexual harassment moved into the halls of Congress after California Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier went public with her own experience of unwanted sexual advances as a young Capitol Hill staffer. Speier s revelation actually inspired Leeann Tweeden to come forward with her allegations against Senator Franken.This week, Congresswoman Speier introduced legislation in the House aimed at fighting sexual harassment in Congress. And she joins us this morning from Palm Springs, California. Congresswoman, I want to start with something you wrote. You said that,  It s clear the good old boys club mentality of Capitol Hill still persists after all these years. It is perhaps the worst I ve seen in 30 years of working on these issues.  The old boys club was pretty bad. You re saying it s worse now?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, I think it s worse in part because we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked. Doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified. So the Office of Compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed.JOHN DICKERSON: As Congress and the larger culture tries to figure out what the standard is for treating accusers who come forward, something better than what has been where they ve been blocked, but also something that doesn t allow false accusations, how does that standard get determined, in your mind?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, we have to make sure that a complaint is taken seriously. And the person who is the victim is not somehow tortured or intimidated into not filing the complaint. That s what it is right now in Congress. There s a one month period where you re counseled. There s another month where you go through mandatory mediation and you have to sign a non disclosure agreement at the front end.And then you have a month of cooling off period. I mean, that is truly ridiculous. It s important for us to remember too, John, that over 90% of those who have been sexually harassed or sexually assaulted are telling the truth. So all these victims who have come forward with Roy Moore or with the president or with Al Franken, all of them have to be, we expect to believe them because, for the most part, they are telling the truth. There is no gain for them to come forward. There re lots of down sides, frankly.JOHN DICKERSON: What s your view about reevaluating the situation? You mentioned the president. The White House seems to suggest, and Senator Cotton also seemed to suggest that the voters knew about this. They voted for him. And so it s an issue that s in the past. How do you see it?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, I think there is some truth to that. If the president was running today, I bet he would not be elected because I think we have had a huge cultural shift that was 40 years in the making, but I think all of us are grateful now that there is a new day for women in the workplace, where they do not have to put up with sexual advances that are unwanted. That they do not have to live and work in a hostile work environment. And that s going to be good for all of us in the workplace.JOHN DICKERSON: As that cultural shift takes place, some people have argued, some Democrats and liberals have argued, that a reevaluation of Bill Clinton s presidency is required. What do you think about that in order to be clear about what the new standard is and use, you know, elements from the past that are well known?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, let s remember that he did face impeachment. It wasn t as if it was just tossed to the side. He faced impeachment. I think that the victims who came forward were not treated as they should have been. They should have been believed because, as I have pointed out, most people who come forward are telling the truth.JOHN DICKERSON: In the case of Al Franken, what s your feeling about that? There have been some columnists who ve written that basically again, liberals have said he must leave the Senate in order for Democrats to retain their credibility on this issue, or else they re open to the charge that Democrats apply it when it comes to Republicans, but are more generous when it comes to their own team.JACKIE SPEIER: I think it s appropriate for the ethics committee to do an investigation. Senator Franken has actually agreed to that as well. I also think that it has to be determined if there s a pattern of sexual harassment. Incidents have to be severe or they have to be ones that happen over a period of time. So I think we ll wait and see what the investigation determines.JOHN DICKERSON: Is that an instructive distinction then, pattern versus specific mistake in terms of what might penalize somebody but be the difference between penalizing and expulsion?JACKIE SPEIER: And that s what the Courts have held with sexual harassment cases. If there s a pattern, then sexual harassment is found to be in existence. If it s a one event and it s maybe a conversation versus, you know, sexual assault or an unwanted sexual advance, so it really depends on the circumstances in all of these cases.JOHN DICKERSON: Final question on a different topic, on taxes. Eleven of your Republican colleagues in California voted for the House tax cut bill in which deductibility of state and local taxes is no longer allowed. They were told- at least one of them was told,  Well, that ll get fixed later. And Californians who have high taxes will be able to deduct them.  What s your-do you believe that?JACKIE SPEIER: No, I don t believe it. And I think for all of those members who basically have handed their constituents a $10,000 tax increase, that s what we re talking about. When you take the state and local taxes and the property taxes and the mortgage deduction that is reduced to $500,000, it is a huge hit for every single California family.JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Congresswoman, thanks so much for being with us. And we ll back in one JACKIE SPEIER: Thank you, John.JOHN DICKERSON: minute with White House budget director Mick Mulvaney.\",\n          \"Donald Trump isn t just losing in the polls, and even with his own base, but with a libertarian billionaire donor, too. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal who also destroyed Gawker through lawsuits, and one of the former reality show star s few public supporters in Silicon Valley, has been privately expressing major doubts about the administration, according to a BuzzFeed report.In public, Thiel has said that Trump s administration is  off to a terrific start,  but privately, he s told multiple friends that there is a 50% chance that the current presidency  ends in disaster. Three separate sources told BuzzFeed of Thiel s disparaging remarks about Trump s presidency and others confirmed those accounts as well.In June, Thiel told Trump at a White House event that he is off to a  terrific start  however, privately to friends, Thiel, who served on the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee, has criticized Trump and his administration and developed an increasingly more negative view about the administration.Thiel was one of Trump s most generous campaign donors, gifting his campaign with a $1.25 million donation. Mr. Thiel was also a key liaison to a tech industry that has largely opposed Trump.But now, Thiel is questioning whether Trump can be re-elected while the rest of us aren t even sure he ll last a full term.A spokesperson for Thiel did not deny any of the quotes attributed to him by his friends and colleagues to BuzzFeed News. The night he won the election, I said President Trump would face an awesomely difficult task,  Thiel said in a statement.  Today it s clear that resistance to change in Washington, D.C. has been even fiercer than I anticipated. We still need change. I support President Trump in his ongoing fight to achieve it. When Thiel attended a tech summit at the White House in June, he told the Trump that his  administration is doing very well  but, apparently that s not what Mr. Thiel really thinks of Trump s  presidency  at all. We re wondering why Thiel doesn t have the cajones to be honest with the current occupant of the White House. Sure, just tell Trump that everything is fine while he terrifies the world one tweet at a time. That s the ticket.Meanwhile, Thiel helped to get Trump elected so he s part of the problem.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 828,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"April 24, 2016\",\n          \"September 22, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

To say the least, it didn t go over well, at all. Twitter erupted in brutal mockery of the Trump/Pence logo almost immediately. For reference, here is the image. It may well go down in history as the worst logo ever created.People were quick to point out that  TP  stands for  toilet paper,  which is remarkably appropriate when you consider all the crap that spills from Trump s mouth every time he opens it. And of course, they had to drag poor Beavis into it.Others were more taken aback by the way the  T  penetrates the  P.  An angle that Samantha Bee from Full Frontal had quite a bit of fun with, posting the following GIF with the caption Breaking the Mattress of America. Breaking the mattress of America. pic.twitter.com/M4Cq62YS2c  Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) July 15, 2016Apparently, the heat got a little too hot for the presumptive Republican nominee, because by Saturday morning the logo had completely vanished. Trump and his conservative minions had scrubbed the image. Trump s website no longer features the logo or even a picture of his new running mate, instead going with just a picture of the bigoted billionaire himself and his trademark slogan Make America great again. The logo is also missing in action from Republican the National Committee s website.If Trump and his new best buddy Pence thought it would be that easy to erase the existence of their disastrous logo failure, they clearly don t have a full understanding of how this whole internet works. This pitiful blunder will live on, if only for our amusement. In the future, Trump s campaign would be well advised to use a different design company when it comes to creating their logos. Honestly, you have to wonder if the logo s creator was really so clueless that the obvious shortcomings of the design just happened to slip under their radar, or if the image was just a very public trolling. Either way, Trump is trying really hard to pretend it didn t happen.Featured image via Real Time Politics and Twitter screen capture\",\n          \"How many times more are we going to get to say this before 2017?  While Republicans were bashing Obama for <insert situation here>, he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do.  This is a common theme between Republicans and President Obama. Every time President Obama does something good, they call it the biggest disaster imaginable. Do they think we re not watching?Remember during President Obama s Iranian nuclear deal, when Republicans said  going easy  on Iran (translation   not invading their country) would only make them a worse threat?Huge shock incoming: literally nothing Republicans swore would happen from the Iran deal happened. In fact, yet again the exact opposite happened.The latest proof of President Obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent Iranian elections. Supporters of Hassan Rouhani swept to power in run-off elections that gave the Iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the Iranian parliament for the first time in over 10 years.Forty-two percent of the total seats were won by Rouhani s moderate supporters. Independents took nearly 30 percent of the remaining seats, and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists. This leaves a paltry 28 percent left for the Iranian hardliners, which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table,  where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm.The landslide success of the Iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between President Rouhani and the United States. The deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of Iran, and Rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the Iranian people.The seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate. President Obama not only won on the Iran deal, but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone.As if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in Iran, the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights. This is IRAN we are talking about. The idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding, considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades.While Iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the West anytime soon, just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how President Obama did on the Iran deal.Republicans just can t win when it comes to President Obama. Every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly, he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the GOP. We sure are going to miss him.Featured image via Getty\",\n          \"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland said on Monday that the legislative process overhauling  its judiciary is in line with European standards and called the European Commission s concerns about rule of law in the country groundless. On July 26, the Commission said it would launch legal action against Poland over the reforms and gave Warsaw a month to respond to concerns that the process undermines the independence of judges and breaks EU rules. Last month, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed into a law a bill giving the justice minister the power to replace heads of ordinary courts, but after mass street protests blocked two other bills. The vetoed bills would have empowered the government and parliament to replace Supreme Court judges and most members of a high-level judicial panel.  In response ... the Polish side emphasized that the legislative process which has the primary goal of reforming the justice system is in line with European standards and answers  social expectations that have been growing for years, therefore the Commission s doubts are groundless,  the foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry also said that  in the spirit of loyal cooperation  it has provided the European Commission with all necessary information on the situation in Poland.  Poland s right-wing, eurosceptic government says the reforms are needed to streamline a slow, outdated legal system and make judges more accountable to the people. It has already tightened control of state media and took steps that critics said politicized the constitutional court. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1544,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"March 2, 2016 \",\n          \"June 28, 2016\",\n          \"October 16, 2016 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

To say the least, it didn t go over well, at all. Twitter erupted in brutal mockery of the Trump/Pence logo almost immediately. For reference, here is the image. It may well go down in history as the worst logo ever created.People were quick to point out that  TP  stands for  toilet paper,  which is remarkably appropriate when you consider all the crap that spills from Trump s mouth every time he opens it. And of course, they had to drag poor Beavis into it.Others were more taken aback by the way the  T  penetrates the  P.  An angle that Samantha Bee from Full Frontal had quite a bit of fun with, posting the following GIF with the caption Breaking the Mattress of America. Breaking the mattress of America. pic.twitter.com/M4Cq62YS2c  Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) July 15, 2016Apparently, the heat got a little too hot for the presumptive Republican nominee, because by Saturday morning the logo had completely vanished. Trump and his conservative minions had scrubbed the image. Trump s website no longer features the logo or even a picture of his new running mate, instead going with just a picture of the bigoted billionaire himself and his trademark slogan Make America great again. The logo is also missing in action from Republican the National Committee s website.If Trump and his new best buddy Pence thought it would be that easy to erase the existence of their disastrous logo failure, they clearly don t have a full understanding of how this whole internet works. This pitiful blunder will live on, if only for our amusement. In the future, Trump s campaign would be well advised to use a different design company when it comes to creating their logos. Honestly, you have to wonder if the logo s creator was really so clueless that the obvious shortcomings of the design just happened to slip under their radar, or if the image was just a very public trolling. Either way, Trump is trying really hard to pretend it didn t happen.Featured image via Real Time Politics and Twitter screen capture\",\n          \"How many times more are we going to get to say this before 2017?  While Republicans were bashing Obama for <insert situation here>, he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do.  This is a common theme between Republicans and President Obama. Every time President Obama does something good, they call it the biggest disaster imaginable. Do they think we re not watching?Remember during President Obama s Iranian nuclear deal, when Republicans said  going easy  on Iran (translation   not invading their country) would only make them a worse threat?Huge shock incoming: literally nothing Republicans swore would happen from the Iran deal happened. In fact, yet again the exact opposite happened.The latest proof of President Obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent Iranian elections. Supporters of Hassan Rouhani swept to power in run-off elections that gave the Iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the Iranian parliament for the first time in over 10 years.Forty-two percent of the total seats were won by Rouhani s moderate supporters. Independents took nearly 30 percent of the remaining seats, and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists. This leaves a paltry 28 percent left for the Iranian hardliners, which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table,  where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm.The landslide success of the Iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between President Rouhani and the United States. The deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of Iran, and Rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the Iranian people.The seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate. President Obama not only won on the Iran deal, but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone.As if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in Iran, the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights. This is IRAN we are talking about. The idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding, considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades.While Iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the West anytime soon, just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how President Obama did on the Iran deal.Republicans just can t win when it comes to President Obama. Every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly, he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the GOP. We sure are going to miss him.Featured image via Getty\",\n          \"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland said on Monday that the legislative process overhauling  its judiciary is in line with European standards and called the European Commission s concerns about rule of law in the country groundless. On July 26, the Commission said it would launch legal action against Poland over the reforms and gave Warsaw a month to respond to concerns that the process undermines the independence of judges and breaks EU rules. Last month, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed into a law a bill giving the justice minister the power to replace heads of ordinary courts, but after mass street protests blocked two other bills. The vetoed bills would have empowered the government and parliament to replace Supreme Court judges and most members of a high-level judicial panel.  In response ... the Polish side emphasized that the legislative process which has the primary goal of reforming the justice system is in line with European standards and answers  social expectations that have been growing for years, therefore the Commission s doubts are groundless,  the foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry also said that  in the spirit of loyal cooperation  it has provided the European Commission with all necessary information on the situation in Poland.  Poland s right-wing, eurosceptic government says the reforms are needed to streamline a slow, outdated legal system and make judges more accountable to the people. It has already tightened control of state media and took steps that critics said politicized the constitutional court. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1544,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"March 2, 2016 \",\n          \"June 28, 2016\",\n          \"October 16, 2016 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

To say the least, it didn t go over well, at all. Twitter erupted in brutal mockery of the Trump/Pence logo almost immediately. For reference, here is the image. It may well go down in history as the worst logo ever created.People were quick to point out that  TP  stands for  toilet paper,  which is remarkably appropriate when you consider all the crap that spills from Trump s mouth every time he opens it. And of course, they had to drag poor Beavis into it.Others were more taken aback by the way the  T  penetrates the  P.  An angle that Samantha Bee from Full Frontal had quite a bit of fun with, posting the following GIF with the caption Breaking the Mattress of America. Breaking the mattress of America. pic.twitter.com/M4Cq62YS2c  Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) July 15, 2016Apparently, the heat got a little too hot for the presumptive Republican nominee, because by Saturday morning the logo had completely vanished. Trump and his conservative minions had scrubbed the image. Trump s website no longer features the logo or even a picture of his new running mate, instead going with just a picture of the bigoted billionaire himself and his trademark slogan Make America great again. The logo is also missing in action from Republican the National Committee s website.If Trump and his new best buddy Pence thought it would be that easy to erase the existence of their disastrous logo failure, they clearly don t have a full understanding of how this whole internet works. This pitiful blunder will live on, if only for our amusement. In the future, Trump s campaign would be well advised to use a different design company when it comes to creating their logos. Honestly, you have to wonder if the logo s creator was really so clueless that the obvious shortcomings of the design just happened to slip under their radar, or if the image was just a very public trolling. Either way, Trump is trying really hard to pretend it didn t happen.Featured image via Real Time Politics and Twitter screen capture\",\n          \"How many times more are we going to get to say this before 2017?  While Republicans were bashing Obama for <insert situation here>, he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do.  This is a common theme between Republicans and President Obama. Every time President Obama does something good, they call it the biggest disaster imaginable. Do they think we re not watching?Remember during President Obama s Iranian nuclear deal, when Republicans said  going easy  on Iran (translation   not invading their country) would only make them a worse threat?Huge shock incoming: literally nothing Republicans swore would happen from the Iran deal happened. In fact, yet again the exact opposite happened.The latest proof of President Obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent Iranian elections. Supporters of Hassan Rouhani swept to power in run-off elections that gave the Iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the Iranian parliament for the first time in over 10 years.Forty-two percent of the total seats were won by Rouhani s moderate supporters. Independents took nearly 30 percent of the remaining seats, and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists. This leaves a paltry 28 percent left for the Iranian hardliners, which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table,  where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm.The landslide success of the Iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between President Rouhani and the United States. The deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of Iran, and Rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the Iranian people.The seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate. President Obama not only won on the Iran deal, but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone.As if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in Iran, the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights. This is IRAN we are talking about. The idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding, considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades.While Iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the West anytime soon, just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how President Obama did on the Iran deal.Republicans just can t win when it comes to President Obama. Every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly, he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the GOP. We sure are going to miss him.Featured image via Getty\",\n          \"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland said on Monday that the legislative process overhauling  its judiciary is in line with European standards and called the European Commission s concerns about rule of law in the country groundless. On July 26, the Commission said it would launch legal action against Poland over the reforms and gave Warsaw a month to respond to concerns that the process undermines the independence of judges and breaks EU rules. Last month, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed into a law a bill giving the justice minister the power to replace heads of ordinary courts, but after mass street protests blocked two other bills. The vetoed bills would have empowered the government and parliament to replace Supreme Court judges and most members of a high-level judicial panel.  In response ... the Polish side emphasized that the legislative process which has the primary goal of reforming the justice system is in line with European standards and answers  social expectations that have been growing for years, therefore the Commission s doubts are groundless,  the foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry also said that  in the spirit of loyal cooperation  it has provided the European Commission with all necessary information on the situation in Poland.  Poland s right-wing, eurosceptic government says the reforms are needed to streamline a slow, outdated legal system and make judges more accountable to the people. It has already tightened control of state media and took steps that critics said politicized the constitutional court. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The blasts occurred in Yala, one of the predominantly ethnic, Malay Muslim provinces in the deep south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for decades, with more than 6,500 people killed since 2004 alone. The first bomb did not result in any casualties, but the other two killed one soldier and wounded 18 soldiers and police and two villagers.   It is believed to be the work of violent groups already creating incidents in the area,  Pramote Prom-in, a spokesman for regional security forces, told Reuters.  As with most violence in Thailand s deep south, there was no claim of responsibility. The insurgents are fighting for secession from mostly Buddhist Thailand. Until they were annexed in 1909, Thailand s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat were  part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate. \",\n          \"Hillary Clinton praised London s socialized medicine after a fall down the stairs sent her to the hospital for examination.

Back to the book tour! pic.twitter.com/Fk30HLjNat  Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 16, 2017Does anyone REALLY believe that Hillary Clinton couldn t make three appearances because she fell down the stairs? There are no details out there that say when she did this. She really never wears heels and the photo from last night shows she s wearing short boots. It just seems there s something else going on here besides a simple broken toe.Could it be that Hillary is getting the pushback she didn t expect from interviewers? She bristled and was visibly irritated when asked about Wikileaks in the interview just yesterday on Australian TV (see below).We re just not buying this one but here s what the media had to say about Clinton s cancellation of some interviews while in London:Washington Examiner reported:Hillary Clinton canceled several media appearances Monday while on her book tour in London after she fell down the stairs and broke her toe. I was running down the stairs in heels with a cup of coffee in hand, I was talking over my shoulder and my heel caught and I fell backwards,  Clinton told  The Graham Nortion Show. I tried to get up and it really hurt. I ve broken my toe. I ve received excellent care from your excellent health service. The former Democratic nominee was supposed to do interviews with BBC Radio 4 s  Woman s Hour,  ITV s  This Morning  show and the BBC s  The Graham Norton Show. Clinton has been on tour promoting her book, What Happened, which details her election loss to President Trump.SHE S A REPEAT OFFENDER WHEN IT COMES TO LATENESS:This follows a string of late arrivals by the former US secretary of state over the weekend.Mrs Clinton was an hour and 40 minutes late for a speech at the Cheltenham Literature Festival on Sunday to promote her new book, What Happened.Hillary Clinton finally arrives 1hr 40 mins later than scheduled for her live chat at the Cheltenham Literature Festival pic.twitter.com/ZWxep0TkfW  David Woodland (@DWoodlanditv) October 15, 2017She was also delayed a similar amount of time on Saturday, when she was presented with an honorary doctorate at Swansea University.WHAT S UP WITH HILLARY NOW?She was seen last night going out to dinner with Huma Abedin and a dozen body guards:Her interview in Australia is a crazy ride: She s really come undone in this latest interview Hillary Clinton became visibly irritated during an interview with Australian TV when she was asked about Wikileaks  Assange.The interview with local Australian TV has several delusional moments that reveal her continued bitterness and downright psychosis when it comes to the 2016 election loss to Donald Trump. I think Assange has become a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator,  Clinton said, apparently referring to Russia s Vladimir Putin.When the interviewer noted many people view Assange as a  martyr for free speech and freedom of information. Clinton wasn t having it and shot back: I mean, he s a tool of Russian intelligence. If he s such a martyr for free speech, why doesn t WikiLeaks ever publish anything coming out of Russia? The interviewer then did something our American media never does. She challenged Clinton with this question: Isn t he just doing what journalists do which is publish information when they get it? HERE S WHERE HILLARY GOES OFF THE RAILS: I don t think so,  Hillary snapped.  I think for number one, it s stolen information, and number two, if all you did was publish it, that would be one thing,  she asserted, before claiming there was a  concerted operation between WikiLeaks and Russia and most likely, people in the United States to, as I say, weaponized that information.

He tweeted out that people should  watch closely  and see that there is something  much darker  than the lying and  menacing glares :  There s something wrong with Hillary Clinton. It is not just her constant lying,  he tweeted. It is not just that she throws off menacing glares and seethes thwarted entitlement. Watch closely. Something much darker rides along with it. A cold creepiness rarely seen. The interviewer goes on to ask Hillary about Fox News:.@HillaryClinton says @FoxNews no longer a journalism outfit. pic.twitter.com/DUWM5WphCG  4corners (@4corners) October 16, 2017In more from the interview, it s clear Hillary needs some therapy. She claims that Jim Comey  shivved her . That is a prison term for being murdered with a knife. What the heck made her use that term? Now that s REALLY creepy!She also lied AGAIN and said our voting systems were attacked:\",\n          \"Ammosexuals also tend to be anti-gay bigots, so it s no surprise that this particular unfortunate victim of his own love of his penis extension gun would shoot himself in the bathroom of a Chik-fil-A location.While most of us boycott the Christian chicken chain out of sheer principle, but not the 45-year-old victim of his own hubris. He was apparently pulling up his pants in the facilities of the locations (hey, even gun nut heroes have to use the john now and then, right?) when the Glock pistol went off. Luckily for the unnamed miscreant, the bullet only grazed his leg. Hardly a fatal injury, of course, but still quite unfortunate and dangerous.Local station WHOH tweeted the story, but, at this time, there is not much information. The victim was able walk out of the Chik-Fil-A location and transport himself to a local hospital for medical care. The injury is not serious, and, of course, no charges will be filed.BREAKING: Fairfield Twp police and medics say a man accidentally shot himself in the bathroom of the Chick-fil-a. pic.twitter.com/GwXHFz12MI  WMOH Newswire (@WMOHNEWSWIRE) April 28, 2015That s the real rub, though. This guy luckily only shot himself. However, how many incidences have there been of  responsible gun owners  injuring or even killing other people where the law decides that it was just an accident? Too many to count, really. This is just evidence of the fact that we need tighter laws regarding firearm ownership. Not everyone who is eligible to buy, own, and conceal carry a gun should be able to do so.This guy likely was another nutjob who couldn t bear to be anything but fully locked and loaded, even in a public restroom in a self-proclaimed family restaurant, and he was injured as a result. What about next time, though? And, believe me, there will be a next time. No one who is irresponsible enough to have an  accident  like this is a one-off shooter. In fact, if  he were any sort of normal, responsible gun owner, he d have never been pulling his pants up in a Chik-Fil-A bathroom with a fully loaded gun in the first place.Featured image via video screen capture from NY Daily News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The blasts occurred in Yala, one of the predominantly ethnic, Malay Muslim provinces in the deep south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for decades, with more than 6,500 people killed since 2004 alone. The first bomb did not result in any casualties, but the other two killed one soldier and wounded 18 soldiers and police and two villagers.   It is believed to be the work of violent groups already creating incidents in the area,  Pramote Prom-in, a spokesman for regional security forces, told Reuters.  As with most violence in Thailand s deep south, there was no claim of responsibility. The insurgents are fighting for secession from mostly Buddhist Thailand. Until they were annexed in 1909, Thailand s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat were  part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate. \",\n          \"Hillary Clinton praised London s socialized medicine after a fall down the stairs sent her to the hospital for examination.

We call BS!HRC on The Graham Norton Show, joking about how she caught her heel on some steps & twisted her ankle earlier today. Back to the book tour! pic.twitter.com/Fk30HLjNat  Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 16, 2017Does anyone REALLY believe that Hillary Clinton couldn t make three appearances because she fell down the stairs? There are no details out there that say when she did this. She really never wears heels and the photo from last night shows she s wearing short boots. It just seems there s something else going on here besides a simple broken toe.Could it be that Hillary is getting the pushback she didn t expect from interviewers? She bristled and was visibly irritated when asked about Wikileaks in the interview just yesterday on Australian TV (see below).We re just not buying this one but here s what the media had to say about Clinton s cancellation of some interviews while in London:Washington Examiner reported:Hillary Clinton canceled several media appearances Monday while on her book tour in London after she fell down the stairs and broke her toe. I was running down the stairs in heels with a cup of coffee in hand, I was talking over my shoulder and my heel caught and I fell backwards,  Clinton told  The Graham Nortion Show. I tried to get up and it really hurt. I ve broken my toe. I ve received excellent care from your excellent health service. The former Democratic nominee was supposed to do interviews with BBC Radio 4 s  Woman s Hour,  ITV s  This Morning  show and the BBC s  The Graham Norton Show. Clinton has been on tour promoting her book, What Happened, which details her election loss to President Trump.SHE S A REPEAT OFFENDER WHEN IT COMES TO LATENESS:This follows a string of late arrivals by the former US secretary of state over the weekend.Mrs Clinton was an hour and 40 minutes late for a speech at the Cheltenham Literature Festival on Sunday to promote her new book, What Happened.Hillary Clinton finally arrives 1hr 40 mins later than scheduled for her live chat at the Cheltenham Literature Festival pic.twitter.com/ZWxep0TkfW  David Woodland (@DWoodlanditv) October 15, 2017She was also delayed a similar amount of time on Saturday, when she was presented with an honorary doctorate at Swansea University.WHAT S UP WITH HILLARY NOW?She was seen last night going out to dinner with Huma Abedin and a dozen body guards:Her interview in Australia is a crazy ride: She s really come undone in this latest interview Hillary Clinton became visibly irritated during an interview with Australian TV when she was asked about Wikileaks  Assange.The interview with local Australian TV has several delusional moments that reveal her continued bitterness and downright psychosis when it comes to the 2016 election loss to Donald Trump. I think Assange has become a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator,  Clinton said, apparently referring to Russia s Vladimir Putin.When the interviewer noted many people view Assange as a  martyr for free speech and freedom of information. Clinton wasn t having it and shot back: I mean, he s a tool of Russian intelligence. If he s such a martyr for free speech, why doesn t WikiLeaks ever publish anything coming out of Russia? The interviewer then did something our American media never does. She challenged Clinton with this question: Isn t he just doing what journalists do which is publish information when they get it? HERE S WHERE HILLARY GOES OFF THE RAILS: I don t think so,  Hillary snapped.  I think for number one, it s stolen information, and number two, if all you did was publish it, that would be one thing,  she asserted, before claiming there was a  concerted operation between WikiLeaks and Russia and most likely, people in the United States to, as I say, weaponized that information. Hillary Clinton says Julian Assange is a  tool of Russian intelligence .@HillaryClinton says @JulianAssange is a \\\"tool of Russian intelligence\\\". Watch the interview tonight on #4Corners. pic.twitter.com/htY89d7GVe  4corners (@4corners) October 15, 2017HERE S WHERE ASSANGE NAILS HILLARY:Assange came back at Clinton with a PERFECT description of her  cold creepiness . He tweeted out that people should  watch closely  and see that there is something  much darker  than the lying and  menacing glares :  There s something wrong with Hillary Clinton. It is not just her constant lying,  he tweeted. It is not just that she throws off menacing glares and seethes thwarted entitlement. Watch closely. Something much darker rides along with it. A cold creepiness rarely seen. The interviewer goes on to ask Hillary about Fox News:.@HillaryClinton says @FoxNews no longer a journalism outfit. pic.twitter.com/DUWM5WphCG  4corners (@4corners) October 16, 2017In more from the interview, it s clear Hillary needs some therapy. She claims that Jim Comey  shivved her . That is a prison term for being murdered with a knife. What the heck made her use that term? Now that s REALLY creepy!She also lied AGAIN and said our voting systems were attacked:\",\n          \"Ammosexuals also tend to be anti-gay bigots, so it s no surprise that this particular unfortunate victim of his own love of his penis extension gun would shoot himself in the bathroom of a Chik-fil-A location.While most of us boycott the Christian chicken chain out of sheer principle, but not the 45-year-old victim of his own hubris. He was apparently pulling up his pants in the facilities of the locations (hey, even gun nut heroes have to use the john now and then, right?) when the Glock pistol went off. Luckily for the unnamed miscreant, the bullet only grazed his leg. Hardly a fatal injury, of course, but still quite unfortunate and dangerous.Local station WHOH tweeted the story, but, at this time, there is not much information. The victim was able walk out of the Chik-Fil-A location and transport himself to a local hospital for medical care. The injury is not serious, and, of course, no charges will be filed.BREAKING: Fairfield Twp police and medics say a man accidentally shot himself in the bathroom of the Chick-fil-a. pic.twitter.com/GwXHFz12MI  WMOH Newswire (@WMOHNEWSWIRE) April 28, 2015That s the real rub, though. This guy luckily only shot himself. However, how many incidences have there been of  responsible gun owners  injuring or even killing other people where the law decides that it was just an accident? Too many to count, really. This is just evidence of the fact that we need tighter laws regarding firearm ownership. Not everyone who is eligible to buy, own, and conceal carry a gun should be able to do so.This guy likely was another nutjob who couldn t bear to be anything but fully locked and loaded, even in a public restroom in a self-proclaimed family restaurant, and he was injured as a result. What about next time, though? And, believe me, there will be a next time. No one who is irresponsible enough to have an  accident  like this is a one-off shooter. In fact, if  he were any sort of normal, responsible gun owner, he d have never been pulling his pants up in a Chik-Fil-A bathroom with a fully loaded gun in the first place.Featured image via video screen capture from NY Daily News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The blasts occurred in Yala, one of the predominantly ethnic, Malay Muslim provinces in the deep south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for decades, with more than 6,500 people killed since 2004 alone. The first bomb did not result in any casualties, but the other two killed one soldier and wounded 18 soldiers and police and two villagers.   It is believed to be the work of violent groups already creating incidents in the area,  Pramote Prom-in, a spokesman for regional security forces, told Reuters.  As with most violence in Thailand s deep south, there was no claim of responsibility. The insurgents are fighting for secession from mostly Buddhist Thailand. Until they were annexed in 1909, Thailand s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat were  part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate. \",\n          \"Hillary Clinton praised London s socialized medicine after a fall down the stairs sent her to the hospital for examination.

Back to the book tour! pic.twitter.com/Fk30HLjNat  Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 16, 2017Does anyone REALLY believe that Hillary Clinton couldn t make three appearances because she fell down the stairs? There are no details out there that say when she did this. She really never wears heels and the photo from last night shows she s wearing short boots. It just seems there s something else going on here besides a simple broken toe.Could it be that Hillary is getting the pushback she didn t expect from interviewers? She bristled and was visibly irritated when asked about Wikileaks in the interview just yesterday on Australian TV (see below).We re just not buying this one but here s what the media had to say about Clinton s cancellation of some interviews while in London:Washington Examiner reported:Hillary Clinton canceled several media appearances Monday while on her book tour in London after she fell down the stairs and broke her toe. I was running down the stairs in heels with a cup of coffee in hand, I was talking over my shoulder and my heel caught and I fell backwards,  Clinton told  The Graham Nortion Show. I tried to get up and it really hurt. I ve broken my toe. I ve received excellent care from your excellent health service. The former Democratic nominee was supposed to do interviews with BBC Radio 4 s  Woman s Hour,  ITV s  This Morning  show and the BBC s  The Graham Norton Show. Clinton has been on tour promoting her book, What Happened, which details her election loss to President Trump.SHE S A REPEAT OFFENDER WHEN IT COMES TO LATENESS:This follows a string of late arrivals by the former US secretary of state over the weekend.Mrs Clinton was an hour and 40 minutes late for a speech at the Cheltenham Literature Festival on Sunday to promote her new book, What Happened.Hillary Clinton finally arrives 1hr 40 mins later than scheduled for her live chat at the Cheltenham Literature Festival pic.twitter.com/ZWxep0TkfW  David Woodland (@DWoodlanditv) October 15, 2017She was also delayed a similar amount of time on Saturday, when she was presented with an honorary doctorate at Swansea University.WHAT S UP WITH HILLARY NOW?She was seen last night going out to dinner with Huma Abedin and a dozen body guards:Her interview in Australia is a crazy ride: She s really come undone in this latest interview Hillary Clinton became visibly irritated during an interview with Australian TV when she was asked about Wikileaks  Assange.The interview with local Australian TV has several delusional moments that reveal her continued bitterness and downright psychosis when it comes to the 2016 election loss to Donald Trump. I think Assange has become a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator,  Clinton said, apparently referring to Russia s Vladimir Putin.When the interviewer noted many people view Assange as a  martyr for free speech and freedom of information. Clinton wasn t having it and shot back: I mean, he s a tool of Russian intelligence. If he s such a martyr for free speech, why doesn t WikiLeaks ever publish anything coming out of Russia? The interviewer then did something our American media never does. She challenged Clinton with this question: Isn t he just doing what journalists do which is publish information when they get it? HERE S WHERE HILLARY GOES OFF THE RAILS: I don t think so,  Hillary snapped.  I think for number one, it s stolen information, and number two, if all you did was publish it, that would be one thing,  she asserted, before claiming there was a  concerted operation between WikiLeaks and Russia and most likely, people in the United States to, as I say, weaponized that information.

He tweeted out that people should  watch closely  and see that there is something  much darker  than the lying and  menacing glares :  There s something wrong with Hillary Clinton. It is not just her constant lying,  he tweeted. It is not just that she throws off menacing glares and seethes thwarted entitlement. Watch closely. Something much darker rides along with it. A cold creepiness rarely seen. The interviewer goes on to ask Hillary about Fox News:.@HillaryClinton says @FoxNews no longer a journalism outfit. pic.twitter.com/DUWM5WphCG  4corners (@4corners) October 16, 2017In more from the interview, it s clear Hillary needs some therapy. She claims that Jim Comey  shivved her . That is a prison term for being murdered with a knife. What the heck made her use that term?

He was apparently pulling up his pants in the facilities of the locations (hey, even gun nut heroes have to use the john now and then, right?) when the Glock pistol went off. Luckily for the unnamed miscreant, the bullet only grazed his leg. Hardly a fatal injury, of course, but still quite unfortunate and dangerous.Local station WHOH tweeted the story, but, at this time, there is not much information. The victim was able walk out of the Chik-Fil-A location and transport himself to a local hospital for medical care. The injury is not serious, and, of course, no charges will be filed.BREAKING: Fairfield Twp police and medics say a man accidentally shot himself in the bathroom of the Chick-fil-a. pic.twitter.com/GwXHFz12MI  WMOH Newswire (@WMOHNEWSWIRE) April 28, 2015That s the real rub, though. This guy luckily only shot himself. However, how many incidences have there been of  responsible gun owners  injuring or even killing other people where the law decides that it was just an accident? Too many to count, really. This is just evidence of the fact that we need tighter laws regarding firearm ownership. Not everyone who is eligible to buy, own, and conceal carry a gun should be able to do so.This guy likely was another nutjob who couldn t bear to be anything but fully locked and loaded, even in a public restroom in a self-proclaimed family restaurant, and he was injured as a result. What about next time, though? And, believe me, there will be a next time. No one who is irresponsible enough to have an  accident  like this is a one-off shooter. In fact, if  he were any sort of normal, responsible gun owner, he d have never been pulling his pants up in a Chik-Fil-A bathroom with a fully loaded gun in the first place.Featured image via video screen capture from NY Daily News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
